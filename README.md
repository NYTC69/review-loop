# review-loop

A Claude Code plugin for AI-driven code review with independent adversarial review, automated quality polish, and multi-language static analysis.

## Quick Start

```
/plugin marketplace add NYTC69/review-loop
/plugin install review-loop@review-loop-marketplace
```

Start a new session. The `/review-loop` command is now available in all your projects.

**Optional** — copy the config template to customize per-project defaults:

```bash
cp ~/.claude/plugins/cache/review-loop/review-loop-config.example.md .claude/review-loop-config.md
```

> **After updating the plugin** — Claude Code caches plugin paths at session
> start. After running `/plugin update`, start a new session so it picks up
> the latest version. Old sessions will keep using the version loaded at
> startup.

## Workflow Overview

```
/review-loop <task>
│
├── Step 1 — Planning
│   Executor drafts plan → Adversarial Reviewer critiques → iterate until APPROVE
│
├── Step 2 — Execution
│   Executor implements → Adversarial Reviewer code-reviews → iterate until APPROVE
│
├── Step 3.5 — Quality Polish (automatic)
│   Language-specific static analysis → code quality review →
│   code simplification → test coverage check → comment analysis
│
└── Delivery
    Findings table + quality summary + time breakdown
```

Both the Executor and Reviewer operate independently — the Reviewer is a
different AI (or an isolated sub-agent) that catches blind spots, design
deviations, and unauthorized compromises the Executor would silently ship.

## Example: Rust Repo

```
/review-loop add rate limiting to the upload endpoint using tower middleware
```

**Planning** — The Executor drafts a plan using `tower::limit::RateLimitLayer`.
The Reviewer flags a missing per-IP bucket strategy and rates it CRITICAL.
The Executor revises. The Reviewer approves on round 2.

**Execution** — The Executor implements the plan. The Reviewer catches that the
`RateLimitLayer` was applied globally instead of per-route and flags plan
conformance violation. Fixed and approved on round 2.

**Quality Polish** — `rust-reviewer` runs `cargo clippy`, `code-simplifier`
removes a redundant `.clone()`, `pr-test-analyzer` notes missing test for
the 429 response path.

**Delivery** — Full findings table, quality summary, and time breakdown are
shown. Optionally auto-commits the result.

## Standalone Tools

### `/review-loop:code-quality-loop`

Run quality polish independently on existing code. Same agents as Step 3.5
but triggered on demand — useful for cleaning up code that was written
outside the review-loop workflow.

### `/review-loop:review-pr [aspects]`

Spot-check specific aspects of recent changes. Available aspects:

| Aspect | Agent | What it checks |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `code` | code-reviewer | Style, patterns, best practices |
| `errors` | silent-failure-hunter | Swallowed errors, silent fallbacks |
| `comments` | comment-analyzer | Comment accuracy, staleness |
| `types` | type-design-analyzer | Type design, encapsulation |
| `tests` | pr-test-analyzer | Test coverage, edge cases |
| `simplify` | code-simplifier | Unnecessary complexity |

```
/review-loop:review-pr code errors tests
```

### `/review-loop:guide`

Show the usage guide — how it works, commands, configuration, and key features.

## Configuration

All options live in `.claude/review-loop-config.md`. Every field is optional.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `reviewer` | `codex` | `"codex"` \| `"subagent"` — which backend reviews |
| `reviewer_model` | `""` | codex: `-m` flag; subagent: Agent `model` param (empty = default) |
| `executor_model` | `inherit` | `"inherit"` \| `"sonnet"` \| `"opus"` |
| `soft_limit_plan` | `3` | After N rounds, ask user to continue if CRITICALs remain |
| `soft_limit_exec` | `3` | Same for execution phase |
| `auto_commit` | `false` | Stage changed files and commit after delivery |
| `commit_message_prefix` | `feat` | Conventional commit type prefix |
| `docs_file` | `CHANGELOG.md` | File to append delivery summary; `""` to skip |
| `handsfree` | `false` | Default to hands-free mode (decisions go to Reviewer) |
| `review_focus` | `""` | Project-specific review priorities (free text) |
| `quality_focus` | `""` | What to prioritize in quality polish (free text) |
| `review_style` | `""` | Tone and rules for all reviews (free text) |
| `skip_quality_polish` | `false` | Skip Quality Polish (Step 3.5) entirely |

### Natural language config examples

```yaml
review_focus: |
  - Security: auth checks, input validation, SQL injection
  - Performance: N+1 queries, missing indexes

quality_focus: "strict clippy lints, skip comment analysis"

review_style: "be terse, flag any unwrap() as CRITICAL"
```

## Reviewer Modes

| Mode | Config | How it works |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **codex** (default) | `reviewer: codex` | Calls `codex exec -s read-only` — cross-AI review from a different model |
| **subagent** | `reviewer: subagent` | Claude Code sub-agent with read-only tools — no external CLI required |

The codex mode gives you genuinely independent review from a different AI.
The subagent mode uses a Claude Code sub-agent — convenient when you don't
have Codex installed. Set `reviewer_model` to control which model the
Reviewer uses.

## Included Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `executor` | Implements plans and code changes as a sub-agent |
| `reviewer` | Independent adversarial reviewer (plan + code review) |
| `code-reviewer` | Style, patterns, and best-practice checks |
| `code-simplifier` | Removes unnecessary complexity while preserving behavior |
| `silent-failure-hunter` | Finds swallowed errors, silent fallbacks, inadequate error handling |
| `pr-test-analyzer` | Reviews test coverage quality and completeness |
| `comment-analyzer` | Checks comment accuracy, staleness, and maintainability |
| `type-design-analyzer` | Analyzes type design — encapsulation, invariants, usefulness |
| `go-reviewer` | Go static analysis (`go vet`, `staticcheck`, etc.) |
| `rust-reviewer` | Rust static analysis (`cargo clippy`, etc.) |
| `python-reviewer` | Python static analysis (`ruff`, `mypy`, etc.) |
| `frontend-security-reviewer` | Frontend security: XSS, CSRF, auth state, dependency risks |

## Key Design Features

**Live Reports** — After every review round, the Orchestrator shows you what
the Reviewer found: CRITICAL issues, MINOR suggestions, and the verdict.
You see the value of the review loop in real time.

**Plan Conformance** — The Reviewer checks that the Executor's implementation
stays within the approved plan. Unauthorized design decisions are flagged as
CRITICAL even if the code is technically correct.

**Context File** — All loop state is persisted to
`.claude/review-loop-sessions/{uuid}.md`. Both agents read it each round
for instant context. Session files are preserved for post-hoc traceability.

**Soft Limits + Stuck Detection** — No hard cap on rounds. When the soft limit
is reached and CRITICALs remain, the Orchestrator asks whether to continue.
Stuck detection stops the loop if the same issue recurs 3 rounds without
progress.

**Quality Polish** — After the adversarial review loop approves, a suite of
specialized agents automatically runs static analysis, simplification, test
coverage, and comment checks. Configurable via `quality_focus` and
`skip_quality_polish`.
