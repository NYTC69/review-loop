## Codex Stage 1

Codex uses repo skills under `.agents/skills/`. In Stage 1, the Codex
`review-loop` skill shares `.review-loop/config.md` and `.review-loop/sessions/`
with Claude Code, so both runtimes work against the same project state.
The rest of the user guide primarily documents the Claude Code plugin surface.
Codex Stage 1 additionally exposes `paired-session` as an explicit opt-in while
the familiar legacy route remains the default during staged migration.

The default reviewer path in Codex Stage 1 uses the Claude CLI reviewer
(`claude -p`). If you need to force the Codex fallback reviewer, set
`codex_reviewer_backend: codex` in `.review-loop/config.md`.
The shared `reviewer` and `executor_model` keys do not actively control
Stage 1 Codex reviewer/backend selection.
In Codex Stage 1, `executor_model` is ignored and `codex_executor_model` remains reserved.

Stage 1 does not yet migrate `code-quality-loop`, `review-pr`, or `reorganize`.

## Three Skills: `plan`, `execute`, `review-loop`

Starting in v2.6.0 the workflow is split into three composable skills. Pick
the one that matches where your work currently is:

- **`/review-loop`** — the umbrella. Full plan → execute → polish →
  delivery in one invocation. Step 1.5 auto-routes based on detected state
  (fresh / existing plan / code already implemented). Unchanged external UX
  from earlier versions.
- **`/review-loop:plan`** — planning phase only. Drives a work item to a
  reviewer-approved plan in `.review-loop/sessions/{uuid}.md`, then exits
  with a hand-off hint (`Next: review-loop:execute --session <uuid>`). Use
  this when you want plan-only iteration, or want to plan on one runtime
  and execute on another.
- **`/review-loop:execute`** — execution + quality polish + delivery.
  Three mutually-exclusive entry modes:
  - `--session <uuid>` — resume an approved session. Reviewer strictness
    follows the session's `plan_source` (strict for `reviewer-approved`,
    advisory-for-plan-conformance for `user-supplied`, pure CR for
    `review-only`).
  - `--plan <text|path> --title <title>` — execute a user-supplied plan
    verbatim. `plan_source: user-supplied`; plan-conformance deviations
    become advisory MINOR findings.
  - `--review-only [--description <what was done>]` — pure CR sweep over
    the current working tree. Skips the first Executor round; goes
    straight to the Reviewer.

All three skills share the same session-file schema and can hand off
between invocations (and between runtimes).

### Multi-batch example

Stop cleanly between stages with `--stop-after <stage>`, then resume:

```bash
# 1. Plan-only.
/review-loop:plan split auth middleware into request-scoped + global layers
# → prints session UUID, e.g. a3c4...

# 2. Execute but stop before Quality Polish.
/review-loop:execute --session a3c4... --stop-after before-polish

# 3. Review the diff, then resume — runs polish + docs + security + delivery.
/review-loop:execute --session a3c4...
```

### `--stop-after <stage>` enum (Claude Code)

Claude Code supports the full set of stages:

| Value | Stops |
|---|---|
| `exec-round` | After the current execution round finishes (even on REQUEST_CHANGES) |
| `before-polish` | Before Step 3.5 Quality Polish |
| `before-docs` | Before Step 3.6 Documentation Consistency |
| `before-security` | Before Step 3.7 Security Preflight |
| `before-delivery` | Before Step 4 Delivery |
| `delivery` | Default — no early stop |

Unsupported values are rejected at parse time, before any lock is acquired
or session field is written. (Codex Stage 1 supports only
`exec-round`, `before-delivery`, `delivery` — Steps 3.5 / 3.6 / 3.7 are out
of Stage 1 scope.)

### `--accept-external-state` (unsafe opt-in)

Auto-accepts every "external drift detected — (A) accept / (B) abort"
pause-and-confirm prompt the Orchestrator would otherwise surface
(drift-check decision tree; backward-compat missing-baseline fallback).

**Unsafe**. Use only when you *know* external tree changes between
batches were intentional and you want to reset baseline silently. The
`--handsfree` flag alone does NOT auto-accept drift — this flag must be
passed explicitly.

## Workflow Overview

```
/review-loop <task>
│
├── 1. Planning
│   Executor drafts plan → Adversarial Reviewer critiques → iterate until APPROVE
│
├── 2. Execution
│   Executor implements → Adversarial Reviewer code-reviews → iterate until APPROVE
│
├── 3. Quality Polish (automatic)
│   Language-specific static analysis → code quality review →
│   code simplification → test coverage check → docs consistency
│
└── 4. Delivery
    Findings table + quality summary + time breakdown
```

Both the Executor and Reviewer operate independently — the Reviewer is a
different AI (or an isolated sub-agent) that catches blind spots, design
deviations, and unauthorized compromises the Executor would silently ship.

## Example: Rust Repo

```
/review-loop add rate limiting to the upload endpoint using tower middleware
```

**Planning** — The Executor drafts a plan using `tower::limit::RateLimitLayer`.
The Reviewer flags a missing per-IP bucket strategy and rates it CRITICAL.
The Executor revises. The Reviewer approves on round 2.

**Execution** — The Executor implements the plan. The Reviewer catches that the
`RateLimitLayer` was applied globally instead of per-route and flags plan
conformance violation. Fixed and approved on round 2.

**Quality Polish** — `rust-reviewer` runs `cargo clippy`, `code-simplifier`
removes a redundant `.clone()`, `pr-test-analyzer` notes missing test for
the 429 response path.

**Delivery** — Full findings table, quality summary, and time breakdown are
shown. Optionally auto-commits the result.

## Standalone Tools

### `/review-loop:code-quality-loop`

Run quality polish independently on existing code. Same agents as Step 3.5
but triggered on demand — useful for cleaning up code that was written
outside the review-loop workflow.

### `/review-loop:reorganize <file/dir or 'diff'>`

Restructure code files: rearrange module layout, extract shared logic, remove
redundancy, add section comments. Splits coupled files into focused modules.
Preserves all functionality — this is restructuring, not rewriting.

```
/review-loop:reorganize src/engine.go    # single file
/review-loop:reorganize src/core/        # directory
/review-loop:reorganize diff             # all uncommitted changes
```

### `/review-loop:review-pr [aspects]`

Spot-check specific aspects of recent changes. Available aspects:

| Aspect | Agent | What it checks |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `code` | code-reviewer | Style, patterns, best practices |
| `errors` | silent-failure-hunter | Swallowed errors, silent fallbacks |
| `comments` | comment-analyzer | Comment accuracy, staleness |
| `types` | type-design-analyzer | Type design, encapsulation |
| `tests` | pr-test-analyzer | Test coverage, edge cases |
| `simplify` | code-simplifier | Unnecessary complexity |

```
/review-loop:review-pr code errors tests
```

### `/review-loop:guide`

Show the usage guide — how it works, commands, configuration, and key features.

## Reviewer Modes

| Mode | Config | How it works |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **codex** (default) | `reviewer: codex` | Calls `codex exec -s read-only` — cross-AI review from a different model |
| **subagent** | `reviewer: subagent` | Claude Code sub-agent with read-only tools — no external CLI required |

The codex mode gives you genuinely independent review from a different AI.
The subagent mode uses a Claude Code sub-agent — convenient when you don't
have Codex installed. Set `reviewer_model` to control which model the
Reviewer uses.

## Included Agents

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| `executor` | Implements plans and code changes as a sub-agent |
| `reviewer` | Independent adversarial reviewer (plan + code review) |
| `code-reviewer` | Style, patterns, and best-practice checks |
| `code-simplifier` | Removes unnecessary complexity while preserving behavior |
| `silent-failure-hunter` | Finds swallowed errors, silent fallbacks, inadequate error handling |
| `pr-test-analyzer` | Reviews test coverage quality and completeness |
| `comment-analyzer` | Checks comment accuracy, staleness, and maintainability |
| `type-design-analyzer` | Analyzes type design — encapsulation, invariants, usefulness |
| `go-reviewer` | Go static analysis (`go vet`, `staticcheck`, etc.) |
| `rust-reviewer` | Rust static analysis (`cargo clippy`, etc.) |
| `python-reviewer` | Python static analysis (`ruff`, `mypy`, etc.) |
| `frontend-security-reviewer` | Frontend security: XSS, CSRF, auth state, dependency risks |

## File Structure

The tree below shows the Claude/plugin-side structure. Codex Stage 1 also uses
the runtime paths `.agents/skills/` and `.codex/agents/` for its repo skills
and subagents. Only `review-loop` and `guide` are wired for Codex in Stage 1.
